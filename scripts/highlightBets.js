/**
 * highlightBets.js
 * 
 * Meant to add a highlighting for rows where there is a 0 recommended bet
 * This is so the user doesnt have to look to the right to see if they made the bet
 */

/*
What should my approach be?
    I feel like it would have to be some sort of mutation observer so on load you can set the background
    Also will need to add a onclick event on the bet button to set the background since the bet amount doesnt change
